I am a senior data scientist at [4kst](https://4kst.com/), a deep tech startup. I finished my bachelor's degree in statistics in 2015, and my master's in statistics in 2021. Between these two degrees, I ran my own statistical consultancy company [GP Soluções em Estatística](https://gpestatistica.netlify.app/) impacting over 200 researchers.

I have a strong background in R, and since 2021 I am programming in Python almost everyday. Fell free to contact me.

In my leasure time, I like to travel, make a Brazilian barbecure, and do small repairs at my home.
