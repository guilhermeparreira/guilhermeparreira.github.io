## About this blog

I am a data scientist who loves working with data since 17. I finished my bachelor's degree in statistics in 2015, and my master's in statistics in 2021. In this meantime, I ran my own statistical consultancy company [GP Soluções em Estatística](https://gpestatistica.netlify.app/) impacting over 200 researchers.

I have a strong background in R, and since 2021 I am programming in Python almost everyday.
